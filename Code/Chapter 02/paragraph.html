	There are some alpha-numeric characters such as ‘&lt;’, and ‘&gt;’, and ‘&amp;’ 	that are used in HTML syntax formation. They are referred to as special 	characters. In other words, HTML has reserved certain characters for its own 	use. Using these characters in their original form in a HTML document confuses 	the browser. These characters are not used in their original form but in its 	coded form.
