		Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines and the 
 		branch of computer science which aims to create it. <BLOCKQUOTE>Textbooks 
 		define the field as the study and design of intelligent agents, where an 
 		intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes 
 		actions which maximize its chances of success. John McCarthy, who coined 
 		the term in 1956, defines it as the science and engineering of making 
 		intelligent machines. </BLOCKQUOTE>
